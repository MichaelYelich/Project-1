	<p> The story takes place in a fictional world where a large number of individuals have super powers. These powers are unlocked when a individual goes throug ha tramatic experience and can influence their powers. The main character, Taylor, is one such individual, who's bullies stuffed her in a locker and poured insects on her. I can't go much futher without spoiling the book, but it is a great series and is free.<p>
